                My name is <strong>Isidora Wright!</strong> I am a junior at Texas A&M University, pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in 
                Computer Engineering with a minor in cybersecurity. I am also pursuing a graduate certificate in cybersecurity.
                I am a part of Aggie Coding Club (ACC) as well as Cybersecurity Club. I have just recently joined the ACC, but I have
                been in the Cyber Club for one year now. I took a Codepath cybersecurity course last year that covered the basics
                of cybersecurity.

                This past summer, from June 6, 2022 - August 12, 2022, I did a cybersecurity internship with the Department of Energy (DOE) 
                in Idaho Falls, Idaho. My project was to create a gap analysis between NIST 800-53 revision 4 and revision 5. During my internship,
                I got the opportunity to go to Sandia Labs in Albuquerque, New Mexico for the TracerFire Training. The entirety of the training was
                tracking the forensic footsteps of adversaries. Despite being fairly new to cybersecurity, my team and I got second place in the 
                compettion that they held as well as got real life experience on what incident response is all about.
